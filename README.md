### I've been in the Navy for 12 years. I am a Gas Turbine Systems Electrician but am looking to break into the cyber domain.  Aside from a few networking classes I took before joining the military, I don't have any formal training or experience in the field. I enjoy analytical problem solving and learning and really a domain that is ever changing and evolving.
