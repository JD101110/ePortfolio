# My name is Jonte Dalton and I've been in the Navy for 11 and a half years. I am a Gas Turbine Systems Electrician but am looking to break into the cyber domain. I don't have too much formal education in IT/Cyber aside from a few networking classes I took before joinin the military. I enjoy analytical problems and learning and really a domain that is ever changing and evolving.
